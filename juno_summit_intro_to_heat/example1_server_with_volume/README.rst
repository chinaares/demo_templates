Description
-----------
 This is a simple example, which demonstrates the structure of a HOT template:
    * How parameters are defined, including examples of using constraints
    * Resource definition for an instance and a volume, including a simple user-data script
    * Example of defining a stack output, to expose a resource attribute as a stack output
